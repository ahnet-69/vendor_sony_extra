    An example of pre-grant list is following:

      <exceptions>
         <exception package="com.example.a">
            <permission name="android.permission.BODY_SENSORS" fixed="false"/>
         </exception>
         <exception package="com.example.b">
            <permission name="android.permission.BODY_SENSORS" fixed="true"/>
            <permission name="android.permission.READ_CALENDAR" fixed="false"/>
            <permission name="android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR" fixed="false"/>
         </exception>
      </exceptions>


    The xml format of pre-grant list is following:

     - <exceptions>
        - It represents list of <exception>
        - It contains some <exception>

     - <exception package="***">
        - It represents a setting about one package that wanted to apply pre-grant processing
        - It contains some <permission>

        - [package] attribute represents the package name
           Value : [string]

     - <permission name="***" fixed="***">
        - It represents a setting about one permission that is pre-granted for the package of
          <exception>

        - [name] attribute represents the permission name
           Value : [string]

        - [fixed] attribute represents a flag for systemFixed setting of the permission
           Value : [true, false]

           true set the permission systemFixed, false does not set the permission systemFixed.
           In case of systemfixed is not defined does not set the permission systemFixed.


    The pre-grant processing behavior in the above example is described following:

     - Package com.example.a
        - The following permission is pre-granted:
           - android.permission.BODY_SENSORS   (Not set as systemFixed)

          User can change the granting state of com.example.a's BODY_SENSORS permission in UI.
          In this case, The following permission group can be changed in UI:
           - Body Sensors

     - Package com.example.b
        - The following permission are pre-granted:
           - android.permission.BODY_SENSORS   (Set as systemFixed)
           - android.permission.READ_CALENDAR  (Not set as systemFixed)
           - android.permission.WRITE_CALENDAR (Not set as systemFixed)

          User can not change the granting state of com.example.b's BODY_SENSORS permission in UI.
          And, User can change the granting state of com.example.b's READ_CALENDAR permission and
          WRITE_CALENDAR permission in UI.
          In this case, the following permission group can be changed in UI:
           - Calendar
